NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFobGZkamx5ZnJycm50Z2xlc3poIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkxMTc4NzksImV4cCI6MjA3NDY5Mzg3OX0.w6OcF_eubIQD6CtxouR7hGFxBV0LPtk8qhy8LETAmhw

# OpenStates API
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENSTATES_API_KEY=7fffc14f-6f2d-4168-ac04-628867cec6b1
```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ahlfdjlyfrrrntgleszh
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `database-setup-complete.sql`
